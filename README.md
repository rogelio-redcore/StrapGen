# StrapGen
Strap Chart Generator
ReadInChems – This will get used for single well and has remained the way it was in case the zipper option does not help/work for your crew and need to revert back.
ZipperStrapGen – This will auto generate what is needed for a zipper job.

 

For a zipper well, you will notice this message box pop up and ask you to either provide a file with the well names and total stages or manually enter them.

When you have a generated sheet you will notice a new tab that also gets generated labeled as “Well Names”. I wouldn’t delete it, this is the heart of the zipper sheet.
I normally just hide it and forget about it. It basically makes a hash table of the well names and stage number so that it knows how to cross reference stage totals.
 
When it gets generated, if you’ll notice the bottom left there is a new column that gets generated where you have a drop down box for each well and a cell where you type in the stage number.
You just need to worry about this one extra step.
